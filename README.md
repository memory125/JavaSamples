# JavaSamples
This repo is used to my java programming samples created by Eclipse.
Â 
## 1. HelloWorld.java
   > * Simple output codes.
   > * Use some libs (e.g. Time, File, FileReader and BufferedReader) to implenment specific features (e.g. read txt file and convert to string).

## 2. JavaSQLOperation.java
   > * It should add the connector sqlite-jdbc-3.19.3.jar to this Eclipse project.
   > * Create the database and table by SQLite.
   > * Access the database and table to query data.
   > * Update the database data.
   > * Delete the database data.

## 3. JavaMySQLOperation.java
   > * It should add the connector mysql-connector-java-5.1.43-bin.jar to this Eclipse project. 
   > * Access the database and table to query data.
   
## 4. JavaJsonOperation.java
   > * It shoud add the connector gson-2.8.1.jar to this Eclipse project.
   > * Read the json file and parse it.
   
## 5. JavaNetOperationClient.java & JavaNetOperationServer.java
   > * This is a simple socket programming sample.
   > * Client side access the server by create socket by specific server name and port.
   > * Server accept the access from client side by create server socket with the same port.
   > * After establish the connection between server and client, then can send and receive messages each other.
   > * About how to run in Eclipse simultaneously, please run server first and then run client.
